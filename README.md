<!--I tried adding an image. I watched some videos, added a folder, but it just didn't work. After 2 hours, it was class almost time for class and I needed a break first. But I'm glad I tried! Also I did not merge the main and master branches. I was not sure if I was supposed to or not?? I did read up on it and found that you can pick either the main or master, but if you pick master, you will have to set it to "default" since main is the default for github. If you look at my index for the hello-html, I don't think there is anything there because I forgot to save before pushing it. I learned so much this week!!-->
